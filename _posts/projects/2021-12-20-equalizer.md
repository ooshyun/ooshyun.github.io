This project is starting to implement an equalizer in the embedded device. Since the limitation of the edge device has a small computation capacity, it needs the filter application for adjusting the low-frequency band significantly below 200Hz. As a personal project for research and testing in a python environment, the inspiration is from a simple parallel or cascaded Infinite Impulse Response(IIR) filter <a href="https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19355">[1]</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6891289/">[2]</a>. The process using equalizer simulates in filtfilt and filt function in scipy.signal library also for implementing those functions.

    <em> Structure of cascaded IIR filters </em>
    </p>
</p>

Specifically, I designed a biquid filter for high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, shelf, peak, and notch forms. And also it tested parallel IIR filter application, which used mainly wrapped fixed pole design and minimum phase through Hilbert Transform. The code for those designs and test is on the <a href="https://github.com/ooshyun/FilterDesign">github</a>. The code includes not only the implementation of the filter but also filt function in c and several digital signal processing examples such as <a href="https://github.com/ooshyun/FilterDesign/tree/master/study/fft_scratch">vanilia fft</a>. The list of details is as below.
