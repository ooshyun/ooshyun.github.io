When designing the interface circuit between Memory and CPU, this circuit needs another block related to a different clock. Since not only two components but also every hardware had its clock rate, this independent circuit for synchronization is necessary when writing the data. For this reason, I started designing this circuit after creating the PHY interface block.

    <em> The procedure of Delay Locked Loop </em>

Specifically, this circuit gives the accurate clock for the next destination, such as the CPU. The logic diagram constituted as Coarse and Fine control for this goal. The Coarse control has a delay cell with NAND and NOT gate, and the counting is on Ring-counter, a group of D-flip flops. After the difference between the target clock and the tuning clock is under the range, it goes to fine-tuning seamlessly. This fine control includes phase interpolation, a digital loop filter for controlling the circuits, and a phase detector for judging the correct timing for synchronization. Those features are simulated by process, temperature, and voltage simulation. After designing the circuits, the layout/PCB design/estimation is as follows. The abstract application is as below.

**Application**
- Coarse and Fine control line
- Inverter-based-phase interpolation in fine control
- Digital Loop Filter with SAR decision circuit
- Phase rotating
- Self-calibrated offset Phase Detector with digital method
